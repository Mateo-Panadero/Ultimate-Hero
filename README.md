# Ultimate H.E.R.O.

Remember H.E.R.O.? An ancient 8 bit game by Activision made famous on the Atari 2600. [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn8Nn69dkcM).
Because of the 'simple'game mechanics I chose to recreate this game while learning Zenject.

## Dependency Inversion in Unity3D with Zenject

Dependency Injection (DI) or Inversion of Control (IoC) can be tedious in Unity. 
Here's where Zenject comes in. A framework designed for Unity3D.

## What is Zenject?
Zenject is a lightweight dependency injection framework built specifically to target Unity 3D (however it can be used outside of Unity as well). It can be used to turn your application into a collection of loosely-coupled parts with highly segmented responsibilities. Zenject can then glue the parts together in many different configurations to allow you to easily write, re-use, refactor and test your code in a scalable and extremely flexible way.
